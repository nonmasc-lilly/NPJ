# New ProJect
## Lilly H. St Claire

NPJ is a simple utility program which creates projects of set prefixes. These prefixes follow:

- `C` simply creates a `README.md`, and `Makefile` files as well as `src`, and `build`
directories
- `CM` similar to the above but creates a `CMakeLists.txt` file instead of a `Makefile`
- `CB` similar to the above but creates a `make.sh` file instead of a `Makefile`
